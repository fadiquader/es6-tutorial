## Summary
ES6 brought in a concept widely recognized in the computer science field: object-oriented programming. Let’s review what that means in terms of classes, inheritance, and more.

Object-oriented programming models “objects” to real world objects, assigning state and relevant methods to those “objects.”

Encapsulation, keeps data safe from use outside of classes.

Inheritance occurs when a class extends another class, receiving all the same behavior from that base class.

A class in es6 holds pertinent data and methods and also allows for simple inheritance.

Extends is an es6 keyword that signals a class inheriting data from a base class

Classes in es6 welcome a whole new realm of possible programming in es6. Also, JavaScript classes compared to other languages feature a much more understandable syntax. Not to mention that the actual inheritance occurs much more smoothly when compared to the object-oriented programming models featured elsewhere.
